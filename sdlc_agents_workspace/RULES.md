# Project Instincts & Learned Rules

This file acts as the long-term memory for the AI agent team. The Observer agent will automatically append new technical learnings here to ensure the team does not repeat past mistakes.

### General Directives
- Always adhere to PEP 8 standards using `ruff`.
- Never generate unnecessary documentation unless explicitly instructed.
- Always use Mermaid.js for architectural diagrams.
